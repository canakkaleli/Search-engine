# Search-engine
This search engine is my first college project at Technical University of Munich. It is an object oriented implementation of a small search engine with Google's PageRank Algorithm. While I was working on it, it made a lot of fun to me. Any advice for improvement will be appreciated!

Note: The project based on weekly assignments from our Professors. In some cases it was forbidden to use basic methods, so we had to use our ways to solve problems.
